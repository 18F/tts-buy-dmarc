## Background

As mentioned, TTS is seeking providers of DMARC related services. TTS applies modern methodologies and technologies to improve the publicâ€™s experience with Government by helping agencies make their services more accessible, efficient, and effective, and by itself providing services that exemplify these values. To meet that goal, TTS builds and shares TTS technology applications and platforms with Federal agencies in an effort to help them better serve the public. 

In October, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued Binding Operational Directive (BOD) [BOD 18-01](https://cyber.dhs.gov/bod/18-01/), a compulsory directive that requires all Federal agency domains implement Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC) policies by October 2018 in order to improve email security. 

As part of this process, TTS is seeking information from vendors in order to determine which companies have the skills to support these efforts and how they would go about providing those services to the U.S. Federal Government. Specifically, we are looking for companies who operate in an agile manner and ensure their offerings are always improved upon in an iterative and regular fashion.
